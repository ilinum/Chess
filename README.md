# Chess
An implementation of chess in Java


<img src="Chess_screenshot.png" width="50%" height="50%"/>


Here is the jar file: 
[Chess-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar](https://github.com/ilinum/Chess/raw/master/Chess-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar)

To run it, just type `java -jar Chess-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`
(It requires Java 8)


##The fun part
Here's the fun part: you can easily build your own AI with this. All you have to do is add this jar to dependencies, and then call GameRunner.runGame() with one of parameters being your implementation of Player interface. 
Please let me know if you build something like that, so I can link to it from this README!
